Docker image for Swift all-in-one demo deployment

This is an attempt to dockerize the instructions for a [Swift All-in-one deployment](https://docs.openstack.org/swift/latest/development_saio.html).

Swift requires xattr to be enabled. With the overlay2 storage driver, Docker
supports extended attributes. However, if you're using the older AUFS storage
driver, it isn't possible for Swift to use storage within the Docker image.
The workaround for this is to mount a volume from a filesystem where xattr is
enabled (e.g. ext4 or xfs).

If you'd like the data to be persistent, you should also store it in an external
volume.

You can pull the images from the DockerHub registry:
```
docker pull dockerswiftaio/docker-swift:latest
```

If you need a specific version of Swift, or would like to pin to a specific
version (recommended), you can pull the specific version like this:
```
docker pull dockerswiftaio/docker-swift:2.24.0
```

## This works:

This uses Docker's storage:
```
docker pull dockerswiftaio/docker-swift
docker run -P -t dockerswiftaio/docker-swift
curl -v -H 'X-Storage-User: test:tester' -H 'X-Storage-Pass: testing' http://127.0.0.1:<port>/auth/v1.0
curl -v -H 'X-Auth-Token: <token-from-x-auth-token-above>' <url-from-x-storage-url-above>
swift -A http://127.0.0.1:<port>/auth/v1.0 -U test:tester -K testing stat
```

To persist data, you can replace the `docker run` command with the following:
```
docker run -P -v /path/to/data:/swift/nodes/1/node/sdb1 -t dockerswiftaio/docker-swift
```

If you'd like to replace Swift configuration files, you can also bind mount
them. For example:
```
docker run -P -v /path/to/proxy-server.conf:/etc/swift/proxy-server.conf -t dockerswiftaio/docker-swift
```

Discover the port by running `docker ps`, which will give output like this:

```
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                                COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS         PORTS                     NAMES
8f892e66b517   dockerswiftaio/docker-swift:2.24.0   "/bin/bash /swift/biâ€¦"   7 seconds ago   Up 6 seconds   0.0.0.0:49177->8080/tcp   magical_bhaskara
```

You want the port that is mapped to port 8080 within the Docker image, in this case 49176.

Get an authorization token like this:

```
curl -v -H 'X-Storage-User: test:tester' -H 'X-Storage-Pass: testing' http://127.0.0.1:<port>/auth/v1.0
```

Result:

```
* About to connect() to 127.0.0.1 port 8080 (#0)
*   Trying 127.0.0.1... connected
> GET /auth/v1.0 HTTP/1.1
> User-Agent: curl/7.22.0 (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu) libcurl/7.22.0 OpenSSL/1.0.1 zlib/1.2.3.4 libidn/1.23 librtmp/2.3

< Date: Mon, 28 Oct 2013 22:48:51 GMT
<
* Connection #0 to host 127.0.0.1 left intact
* Closing connection #0
```

To run the demo.sh script, store the X-Storage-Url and X-Auth-Token values in environment variables:

```
export URL=http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/AUTH_test
export TOKEN=AUTH_tk246b80e9b72a42e68a76e0ff2aaaf051
```

You can then run demo.sh, which will execute a series of curl commands to create
a container, list various information, put itself into Swift as object
"testcontainer/testobject", and retrieve itself again as "retrieved_demo.sh".

## Notes

Uses [supervisord](http://supervisord.org/) to keep the image running. To get a shell on the container, you can use:

```
docker exec -it <container name> /bin/bash
```

Tail /var/log/syslog to see what it's doing.

## Notes on changes from Swift-AIO instructions

- user and group ids are swift:swift
- the instructions provide for using a separate partition or a loopback for
  storage, presumably to allow the storage capacity to be strictly limited.
  Neither of these was easy for a Docker n00b to implement, so I've just used
  /swift, with symbolic links in /srv. The storage can be limited at the OS
  level in the Docker image if it's a concern.
- the Github sources are cloned to /usr/local/src
